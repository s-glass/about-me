        <h2>Education & Work Experience</h2>
        <!-- <p>I have a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Social Work, and have also completed a TEFL certificate to Teach English as a Foreign Language. I worked in schools and nonprofit organizations for over 10 years before deciding to move to Mexico to teach English, which I really enjoyed. I moved back to the US to work in digital marketing, and am now retraining in software development to pursue coding full time! In my spare time, I've coached volleyball and rugby for 10+ years.</p> -->

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal with this bootcamp is to become competent and confident in software development in order to find stable, remote work in the tech field. A few other goals I have are to move back to Mexico someday, become fluent (CEFR B2/C1 level hopefully!) in my third language (Swedish), and continue to find ways to give back to my community. </p>
