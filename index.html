        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal with this bootcamp is to become competent and confident in software development in order to find stable, remote work in the tech field. A few other goals I have are to move back to Mexico someday, become fluent (CEFR B2/C1 level hopefully!) in my third language (Swedish), and continue to find ways to give back to my community. </p>
